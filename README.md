iFi
===

iFi is a simple way to access your Project Fi account on iOS devices. The app is a web view of the standard Project Fi site. The site is not responsive, so the app's content is a bit ugly, but it works.

The app is useful for those wishing to easily check their Fi usage and account info from their homescreen. If you're one of the few people putting a Fi SIM in an iPhone, this app is for you!

Install
-------

Clone the repo, open it in Xcode, and hit run. Release binaries will be added once the app becomes stable.

App Store
---------

This app won't be submitted to the app store, as it is in no way related to Google, there is no support, and I'd not like to be sued.
