iFi
===

iFi is a dead-simple way to access your Project Fi account on iOS devices. The app is a web view of the standard Project Fi site. The site is not responsive, so the app's content is a bit ugly, but it works. 

The app is useful for those wishing to easily check their Fi usage and account info from their homescreen. If you're one of the few people putting a Fi SIM in an iPhone, this app is for you!
